## Abstract

This package provides an interface to make your LaTeX-based invoicing compatible to e-invoicing standards, such as they exist in the EU.

The package includes a demo implementation, which can be used by template developers to create their own company specific variant. The included example file shows how to use it. This package is built so it also creates the XML file which will be directly attached to the PDF.

There also exist interfaces to attach an XML file generated differently. Please have a look at the documentation.

This package does not provide any validation. Please be aware of you have to use valid input data for a valid ZUGFeRD output. The documentation suggests some options.
